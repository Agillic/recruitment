    A practical approach to doing ETL

Draw up a solution (diagram, text, etc..) explaining each step in the
process of a data pipeline for ETL in a production like environment.

The design should cover how to transform data in a scalable way that
can be ingested for training and inference and BI.

Consider, in no particular order, Enabling Agillic partners ETL and
models, continuous delivery of models, Handle data in batches aswell
as streams, Verify data schemas, Version ETL process and perform
rollbacks.

Finally suggest possible techonology choices in tools, frameworks, etc.

The end product should be 15-20 minute presentation that will hopefully
fuel an lively discussion with the one ore more team members.

_Note: This is an intentional open-ended and vague description. There is
not one right solution. It is intended as a starting point for an open
discussion._

# AWS Operations Engineer Assignment

    An approach to a cloud multi-tenancy service

Draw up a high-level solution for an architectual discussion. The design
**must** cover the following services; Organizations, S3, IAM and at least
one proccessing service like Spark EMR, SageMaker or other.

Consider, in no particular order, Development processes, architecture as
code, continuous delivery, monitoring, alerting, versioning and rollback.

The end product should be 20-25 minute presentation that will hopefully
fuel an lively discussion with the one ore more team members.

_Note: This is an intentional open-ended and vague description. There is
not one right solution. It is intended as a starting point for an open
discussion._

# Sr. Machine Learning Engineer Assignment

    A practical approach to implementing a retail recommender engine

Draw up a solution (diagram, text, etc.) explaining each step in the process
of a recommender engine in a production like environment. The design should
cover how to recommend products based on the who, what, when, how, where
principle (i.e. user, item, time, channel, context).  

Consider, in no particular order, Exploration and development processes,
continuous delivery of models, periodically batch inference, model versioning
and rollback.

Finally suggest possible techonology choices in tools, frameworks, etc.

The end product should be 15-20 minute presentation that will hopefully
fuel an lively discussion with the one ore more team members.

_Note: This is an intentional open-ended and vague description. There is not 
one right solution. It is intended as a starting point for an open discussion._
